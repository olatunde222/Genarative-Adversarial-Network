# Genarative-Adversarial-Network
(GANs) are a type of deep learning model that can be used to generate new data, such as images, text, and music. GANs work by using two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator is trained to produce new data that looks like real data, while the discriminator is trained to distinguish between real and fake data.
For this project Fashion - MNIST data set from tensorflow was used for training purpose.
